      {
        "title": "What is MACRS depreciation?",
        "description": "MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) is the depreciation method required by the IRS for most business assets placed in service after 1986. It allows businesses to recover the cost of assets over a predetermined recovery period."
      },
      {
        "title": "Which depreciation method should I use?",
        "description": "The 200% Declining Balance method provides the highest deductions in early years, making it ideal for maximizing early tax benefits. The Straight Line method spreads deductions evenly and may be required for certain asset types. Consult with a tax professional for your specific situation."
      },
      {
        "title": "What is a recovery period?",
        "description": "The recovery period is the number of years over which you can depreciate an asset. Common periods include 5 years for computers and cars, 7 years for office furniture, and 27.5 years for residential rental property. The IRS determines the recovery period based on asset classification."
      },
      {
        "title": "Do I need to consider salvage value?",
        "description": "Under MACRS rules, salvage value is typically assumed to be $0 for depreciation calculations. However, you can enter an estimated salvage value in this calculator to see when depreciation will stop if you plan to sell or dispose of the asset."
      },
      {
        "title": "Is this calculator IRS-compliant?",
        "description": "Yes, this calculator uses depreciation rates from IRS Publication 946. However, for official tax filing, always consult with a qualified tax professional or CPA to ensure compliance with current tax laws."
